Command: git clone
Explanation:
The git clone command is used to make a local copy of a remote repository.
It downloads all the files, commit history, and branches from a Git server (like GitHub) to your computer.
For example:

git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git


This command creates a local folder containing the entire project so you can work on it.
